. Start the app with the following command in the Terminal (within Visual Studio Code):

 npm start

Usually you will start by creating a link:../steps/navigation.steps.feature[navigation] step.

. Create the link:../steps/navigation.steps.feature[navigation] step.
. Use the `debug` feature to navigate to the page.

====
*How to Use the `Debug` Feature?*

. Add the `@runThis` tag to your scenario in the Feature File.
. Hold down the `ctrl` key. This turns the step in the Feature File into a link. Click on the step.
. This will take you to the step function in the `Step Definition` file.
. Add the following keyword as the last line of code within the step function:
+ 
 debugger;
+
. Open the `Debug` screen on the left of Visual Studio Code by clicking on the Debug icon on the left. image::debug-icon.png[]
. Click on the `Play` button at the top of the `Debug` screen to run your test.

NOTE: Don't forget to ensure you're running the correct `Debug` configuration.

*Common Problems*

. `@runThis` tag may not be set in the link:.\protractor.debug.config.ts[protractor.debug.config.ts] file.

====

Once you've navigated to the page, Check the relevant steps files below:

. link:steps/data.steps.feature[Data] 
. link:steps/actions.steps.feature[Actions] 
. link:steps/checks.steps.feature[Checks] 

To see if the steps you need already exist. If the step already exists, follow the guidance in the next chapter called `Using an Exisiting Step`. If you have to create a new one, read the `Creating a New Step` chapter.

== Using an Existing Step

Copy and paste the example step into your scenario.

=== Data Steps


=== Actions and Checks Steps

. Create Locators.

Locators are in the link:../quote-engine-e2e/src/pages/[pages] folder  . Find the correct page.

Page names are in the link:../libs/enums/src/lib/page-url.enum.ts[page-url.enum.ts] file

`ctrl + p` to search the Test Automation Framework.
