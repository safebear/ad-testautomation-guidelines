= Standards

The table below outlines the standards to following when creating tests in the Test Automation Framework.

<MO: Please add to these>

| Standard | Detail

|Naming `Branches`
|Branches are named in the following format `feature/<sizing>/<jira-ticket>` where `sizing` is either `minor` or `major` depending on the amount of effort it would take to implement the ticket. The default is `minor`. For example: `feature/minor/ITD-81892`. 

|Naming `Feature Files`
|Feature files end with the `.feature` extension and are in camel case (e.g. `createQuote.feature`).

|Naming `Pages`
|here are no standards currently for naming `pages`, but this will change!
